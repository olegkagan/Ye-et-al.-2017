Requires R version 3.3.3

Contains R code for three statistical analyses


1. mQTL-enrichment analysis

R code tests whether mQTLs are enriched in GWAS SNPs with small P-values against type 1 diabetes



2. mQTL ~ CpG association analysis

R code tests whether T1D GWAS variants significantly regulate DNA methylation



3. Two Sample Mendelian Randomization

R code tests for the mediation effect of DNA methylation on Type 1 diabetes

4. Reverse MR

Tests for the mediation effect of T1D on DNA methylation
